The brand was launched in the United States and Canada in March 1986, marketing luxury, performance, and high-performance vehicles. It was introduced to Hong Kong in 1991, Mexico in 2004, China in 2006, Russia in 2014 and Kuwait in 2015. Honda\'s plan to introduce Acura to the Japanese domestic market (JDM) in 2008 was delayed, due to economic reasons, and later withheld as a result of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>\n<p>Acura holds the distinction of being the first Japanese automotive luxury brand. The creation of Acura coincided with the introduction of a JDM Honda dealership sales channel, called Honda Clio, which sold luxury vehicles, joining previously established Honda Verno, followed by Honda Primo the following year. In its first few years of existence, Acura was among the best-selling luxury marques in the US. Though sales were down in the mid-to-late 1990s, the brand experienced a revival in the early 2000s, due to drastic redesigns and the introductions of new models.</p>\n<p>In the late 1980s, the success of the company\'s first flagship vehicle, the Legend, inspired fellow Japanese automakers Toyota and Nissan to launch their own luxury brands, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively. The 1990 launch of the NSX, a mid-engine exotic sports car, offered a reliable and practical alternative to exotic European sports cars, and introduced Honda\'s VTEC variable valve timing system to the North American market. The 1993 Legend coup&Atilde;&copy; featured Honda\'s first use of a six-speed manual transmission, mated to a Type II engine. In the late 1990s, Acura produced a Type R version of its compact Integra coup&Atilde;&copy;, which featured a reduced curb weight, a stiffer and lower suspension, and a high-output VTEC engine.</p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, Acura introduced new models, including the company\'s first all-original SUV, the MDX, and two models which replaced the Integra coup&Atilde;&copy; and sedan, the RSX and TSX, respectively. Type-S versions of the RSX, CL, and TL were added to the brand\'s lineup during that decade. Acura\'s 2005 RL flagship introduced SH-AWD, a torque-vectoring all-wheel drive system. The 2007 RDX, a crossover SUV, featured the first North American use of a turbocharged Honda engine. In the 2010s, Acura debuted more new models, including the ILX, TLX, and RLX, the latter of which introduced Acura\'s Jewel Eye LED headlights. A second generation NSX was launched in 2015 and features a twin-turbocharged mid-engine, a nine-speed dual-clutch transmission, and Sport Hybrid SH-AWD.</p>\n<p></p>\n',NULL),(3,'Alfa Romeo','<p><b>Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A.</b>  by Benito Mussolini\'s government, which then had effective control. The company struggled to return to profitability after the Second World War, and turned to mass-producing small vehicles rather than hand-building luxury models. In 1954, it developed the Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine, which would remain in production until 1994. During the 1960s and 1970s, Alfa Romeo produced a number of sporty cars, though the Italian government parent company, Finmeccanica, struggled to make a profit, so it sold the marque to the Fiat Group in 1986.</p>\r\n<p>Alfa Romeo has competed successfully in Grand Prix motor racing, Formula One, sportscar racing, touring car racing, and rallies. It has competed both as a constructor and an engine supplier, via works entries (usually under the name Alfa Corse or Autodelta), and private entries. The first racing car was made in 1913, three years after the foundation of the company, and Alfa Romeo won the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925. The company gained a good name in motorsport, which gave a sporty image to the whole marque. Enzo Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari racing team in 1929 as an Alfa Romeo racing team, before becoming independent in 1939. It holds the world\'s title of the most wins of any marque in the world.</p>\r\n',NULL),(9,'Aston Martin','<p><b>Aston Martin Lagonda Limited</b> is a British manufacturer of luxury sports cars and grand tourers.

The car is regarded as a British cultural icon.</p>\n<p>The company has had a chequered financial history, including bankruptcy in the 1970s, but has also enjoyed long periods of success and stability, including under the ownership of David Brown, from 1947 to 1972 and of the Ford Motor Company from 1994 to 2007.</p>\n<p>In March 2007, a consortium of investors, led by David Richards, purchased 92% of Aston Martin for &Acirc;&pound;479&#160;million, with Ford retaining a &Acirc;&pound;40&#160;million stake. David Richards became chairman of Aston Martin.

Audi oversees worldwide operations from its headquarters in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. Audi-branded vehicles are produced in nine production facilities worldwide.</p>\n<p>The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (Horch and the <i>Audiwerke</i>) founded by engineer August Horch; and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer), leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern era of Audi essentially began in the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz. After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present day form of the company.</p>\n<p>The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder, August Horch. \"Horch\", meaning \"listen\" in German, becomes \"audi\" in Latin. The four rings of the Audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create Audi\'s predecessor company, Auto Union. Audi\'s slogan is Vorsprung durch Technik, meaning \"Advancement through Technology\". However, since 2007 Audi USA has used the slogan \"Truth in Engineering\". Audi, along with BMW and Mercedes are among the best-selling luxury automobile brands in the world.</p>\n',NULL),(11,'Austin','<p><b>The Austin Motor Company Limited</b> was an English manufacturer of motor vehicles, founded in 1905 by Herbert Austin.

Bentley cars are sold via franchised dealers worldwide, and as of November 2012, China was the largest market.</p>\n<p>Most Bentley cars are assembled at the Crewe factory, but a small number of Continental Flying Spurs were assembled at the factory in Dresden, Germany for a brief period when there was insufficient capacity at Crewe. Bodies for the Continental are produced in Zwickau, Germany. Bentley won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1924, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, and 2003.</p>\n<p>Regarded as a British luxury automobile icon, Bentley models include the Bentley 4&Acirc;&frac12; Litre, Bentley Speed Six, Bentley R Type Continental, Bentley Turbo R, and Bentley Arnage. As of 2015, Bentley produce the Continental Flying Spur, Continental GT, Bentley Bentayga and the Mulsanne.</p>\n<p>Rolls-Royce bought Bentley from the receivers in 1931 following a courtroom battle with rival bidder Napier. In 1971, Rolls Royce was forced into receivership following financial problems stemming from the costs of developing the RB211 jet engine. In order to safeguard the company, the UK government nationalised the company and split off the, profitable, motor cars division into a new separate company, Rolls Royce Motors Limited, which included the Bentley brand. Subsequently Rolls Royce Motors was then sold to British engineering conglomerate, Vickers. In 1998, Vickers sold Rolls Royce to Volkswagen AG, however, because the intellectual property rights to the name Rolls Royce, and the famous rectangular badge were owned by Rolls Royce Plc (the aerospace company that had recovered under nationalisation and been subsequently sold back into the private sector), and only licenced to Rolls Royce Motors Limited, the sale to VW did not include these two trademarks with Rolls Royce Plc selling them to rival BMW AG. Therefore the sale included the Bentley name and logos, vehicle designs, model nameplates, production and administrative facilities, the Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grille shape trademarks (subsequently sold to BMW by VW), but not the rights to the Rolls-Royce name or logo which are owned by Rolls-Royce plc.</p>\n<p></p>\n',NULL),(18,'BMW','<p><b>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG</b> , usually known under its abbreviation <b>BMW</b> , is a German luxury vehicle, motorcycle, and engine manufacturing company founded in 1916.

Famous Bugattis include the Type 35 Grand Prix cars, the Type 41 \"Royale\", the Type 57 \"Atlantic\" and the Type 55 sports car.</p>\n<p>The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be the end for the marque, and the death of his son Jean Bugatti in 1939 ensured there was not a successor to lead the factory. No more than about 8,000 cars were made. The company struggled financially, and released one last model in the 1950s, before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in the 1960s. In the 1990s, an Italian entrepreneur revived it as a builder of limited production exclusive sports cars.

The Cadillac crest is based on his coat of arms.</p>\n<p>By the time General Motors purchased the company in 1909, Cadillac had already established itself as one of America\'s premier luxury carmakers. The complete interchangeability of its precision parts had allowed it to lay the foundation for the modern mass production of automobiles. It was at the forefront of technological advances, introducing full electrical systems, the clashless manual transmission and the steel roof. The brand developed three engines, with its V8 setting the standard for the American automotive industry.</p>\n<p>Cadillac was the first American car to win the Royal Automobile Club of England\'s Dewar Trophy by successfully demonstrating the interchangeability of its component parts during a reliability test in 1908; this spawned the firm\'s slogan \"Standard of the World\".

Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918 and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant\'s second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose,\" would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford\'s Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929.</p>\n<p>Chevrolet-branded vehicles are sold in most automotive markets worldwide, with the notable exception of Oceania, where GM is represented by its Australian subsidiary, Holden. In 2005, Chevrolet was relaunched in Europe, primarily selling vehicles built by GM Daewoo of South Korea with the tagline \"Daewoo has grown up enough to become Chevrolet\", a move rooted in General Motors\' attempt to build a global brand around Chevrolet. With the reintroduction of Chevrolet to Europe, GM intended Chevrolet to be a mainstream value brand, while GM\'s traditional European standard-bearers, Opel of Germany, and Vauxhall of United Kingdom would be moved upmarket. However, GM reversed this move in late 2013, announcing that the brand would be withdrawn from Europe, with the exception of the Camaro and Corvette in 2016. Chevrolet vehicles will continue to be marketed in the CIS states, including Russia. After General Motors fully acquired GM Daewoo in 2011 to create GM Korea, the last usage of the Daewoo automotive brand was discontinued in its native South Korea and succeeded by Chevrolet.</p>\n<p>In North America, Chevrolet produces and sells a wide range of vehicles, from subcompact automobiles to medium-duty commercial trucks. Due to the prominence and name recognition of Chevrolet as one of General Motors\' global marques, <b>Chevrolet</b>, <b>Chevy</b> or <b>Chev</b> is used at times as a synonym for General Motors or its products, one example being the GM LS1 engine, commonly known by the name or a variant thereof of its progenitor, the Chevrolet small-block engine.</p>\n',NULL),(36,'Chrysler','<p><b>FCA US LLC</b>, also known as <b>Fiat Chrysler</b> or simply <b>Chrysler</b> (<span class=\"nowrap\"><span class=\"IPA nopopups\">/</span></span>), is the American subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., an Italian controlled automobile manufacturer registered in the Netherlands with headquarters in London, U.K., for tax purposes.

Other major divisions include Mopar, its automotive parts and accessories division, and SRT, its performance automobile division.</p>\n<p>The Chrysler Corporation was founded by Walter Chrysler in 1925, out of what remained of the Maxwell Motor Company. Chrysler greatly expanded in 1928, when Mr. Chrysler, who at one time worked for Buick, acquired the Fargo truck company and the Dodge Brothers Company and began selling vehicles under those brands; that same year it also established the Plymouth and DeSoto automobile brands. The brand diversification efforts were inspired by Mr. Chrysler\'s time working for General Motors, with an emphasis on brand hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Facing postwar declines in market share, productivity, and profitability, as GM and Ford were growing, Chrysler borrowed $250 million in 1954 from Prudential to pay for expansion and updated car designs.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s the company expanded into Europe, by taking control of French, British and Spanish auto companies; Chrysler Europe was sold in 1978 to PSA Peugeot Citro&Atilde;&laquo;n for $1.</p>\n<p>Chrysler struggled through the 1970s to adapt to changing markets, increased US import competition, and safety and environmental regulation. The company began an engineering partnership with Mitsubishi Motors, and began selling Mitsubishi vehicles branded as Dodge and Plymouth in North America. By the late 1970s, Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy, and was saved by $1.5 billion in loan guarantees from the US government. New CEO Lee Iacocca was credited with returning the company to profitability in the 1980s. In 1985, Diamond-Star Motors was created, further expanding the Chrysler-Mitsubishi relationship.</p>\n<p>In 1987, Chrysler acquired American Motors Corporation (AMC), which brought the profitable Jeep brand under the Chrysler umbrella.</p>\n<p>In 1998, Chrysler merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz AG to form DaimlerChrysler; the merger proved contentious with investors and Chrysler was sold to Cerberus Capital Management and renamed Chrysler LLC in 2007.</p>\n<p>Like the other Big Three automobile manufacturers, Chrysler was hit hard by the automotive industry crisis of 2008&acirc;&#128;&#147;2010. The company remained in business through a combination of negotiations with creditors, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on April 30, 2009, and participating in a bailout from the U.S. government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat S.p.A., and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. The bankruptcy resulted in Chrysler defaulting on over $4 billion in debts. By May 24, 2011, Chrysler finished repaying its obligations to the U.S. government five years early, although the cost to the American taxpayer was $1.3 billion. Over the next few years Fiat gradually acquired the other parties\' shares while removing much of the weight of the loans (which carried a 21% interest rate) in a short period. On January 1, 2014, Fiat S.p.A announced a deal to purchase the rest of Chrysler from the United Auto Workers retiree health trust. The deal was completed on January 21, 2014, making Chrysler Group a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. In May 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, NV was established by merging Fiat S.p.A. into the company.

After early financial difficulty and a reorganization of the company in 1904, the Daimler Motor Company was purchased by Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) in 1910, which also made cars under its own name before World War II. In 1933, BSA bought the Lanchester Motor Company and made it a subsidiary of Daimler.</p>\n<p>The company was awarded a Royal Warrant to provide cars to the British Monarch in 1902; it lost this privilege in the 1950s after being supplanted by Rolls-Royce. The company occasionally used alternative technology: the Knight engine which it partially developed in the early twentieth century and used from 1909 to 1935, worm gear final drive fitted from 1909 until after World War II, and the Wilson preselector gearbox used from 1930 to the mid-1950s.</p>\n<p>In the 1950s, Daimler tried to widen its appeal with a line of smaller cars at one end and opulent show cars at the other, stopped making Lanchesters, had a highly publicised removal of their chairman from the board, and developed and sold a sports car and a high-performance luxury saloon and limousine.</p>\n<p>In 1960, BSA sold Daimler to Jaguar Cars, which continued Daimler\'s line and added a Daimler variant of its Mark II sports saloon. Jaguar was then merged into the British Motor Corporation in 1966 and British Leyland in 1968. Under these companies, Daimler became an upscale trim level for Jaguar cars except for the 1968-1992 Daimler DS420 limousine, which had no Jaguar equivalent despite being fully Jaguar-based. Jaguar was split off from British Leyland in 1984 and bought by the Ford Motor Company in 1989. Ford stopped using the Daimler name on Jaguars (or any other cars) in 2007 selling Jaguar to Tata Motors in 2008.
