However, between 1992 and 1996 the Taurus was the best-selling car in the United States, eventually losing the title to the Toyota Camry in 1997. The 1986&acirc;&#128;&#147;1995 Taurus was built on the DN-5 platform, and the 1996&acirc;&#128;&#147;1999 Taurus was built on the DN101 platform. The 2000&acirc;&#128;&#147;2007 Tauruses were built on the D186 which was a modified DN 101 platform.</p>\n<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, sales of the Taurus declined as it lost market share to Japanese midsize sedans and as Ford shifted resources towards developing SUVs. It was discontinued in 2006, with production initially ending on October 27, 2006, and 2007 being the last model year. Ford had decided to replace the Taurus with the fullsize Five Hundred and midsize Fusion sedans, as well as replacing the Taurus wagon with the Freestyle crossover SUV. However, Ford revived the Taurus name during the 2007 Chicago Auto Show a few months later by renaming two new models that had been intended to be updated versions of the Five Hundred and the Freestyle, the \"2008 Taurus\" and \"2008 Taurus X\", respectively. A new model of fullsize Taurus was then released for the 2010 model year, and the 2013 mid-generational refresh (minor model update) was unveiled at the New York Auto Show with minor exterior changes and interior technology options.</p>\n<p></p>\n',8.65,9.75,7.83,9.80,6.02,7240.00,3,NULL),(667,63,'Thunderbird','Ford','<p>The <b>Ford Thunderbird</b> was an automobile that was manufactured by Ford in the United States over eleven model generations from 1955 through 2005.

It can be considered as the saloon version of the second generation Delta, that was launched four years later, in 1993.</p>\n<p>The task of the Dedra was demanding: it must gather the legacy of Prisma, which relaunched the Lancia brand in the field of compact executive cars, and expand its market share if possible. Larger than its predecessor, the Dedra was presented as the second flagship car of Lancia, as a car that could satisfy those looking for an elegant medium-sized sedan but did not want to buy an executive car, as the Thema.</p>\n<p>The design, by Ercole Spada of the I.DE.A Institute, produced an excellent drag coefficient of only 0.29. The core of the product was prestige, exclusivity, personality and comfort, achieved through a high level of equipment and use of materials (e.g. Alcantara) as well as details such as special paints, alloy wheels and an attention to soundproofing, ventilation and other issues. Inside the ability to obtain the perfect driving position was helped by the adjustable seats, steering wheel and electrically adjustable mirrors. Safety, both passive with a structure designed to minimize injury in an accident, and active, such as ABS and airbag, was also near the top of the Dedra\'s agenda.</p>\n<p>It was based on the Fiat Tipo-floorpan, because the idea of Fiat Group at the end of the 80s was to achieve, from a single floorpan (for reasons of economies of scale), four different cars from the same base: good value for money for the Fiat Tipo (1988), elegance for Lancia Dedra 1989, convenience at a competitive price for the Fiat Tempra (1990) (with its large boot) and sportsmanship for the Alfa Romeo 155 (1992). Also were designed on the same floorpan the Lancia Delta and the Fiat Coupe.</p>\n<p>In 1991 was launched the Dedra Integrale. It used the same engine and transmission that the Delta Integrale 8v. The Delta Integrale 8v engine is one of the world\'s most competition proven power units, a 2-litre 4-cylinder fuel injected twin cam engine, fitted with contra-rotating balancing shafts, and a Garrett T3 turbocharger and associated inter-cooler to aid volumetric efficiency that boost power output to 171 PS (127&#160;kW) in catalyzed version. The Dedra Integrale also uses the same permanent 4-wheel drive of the Delta Integrale, and includes the new Visco Drive 2000 traction control system. Also includes the electronically controlled suspension available as option in the 2.0 and upper versions.</p>\n<p>When the Dedra was launched, it was a good time for Lancia: The Thema had been facelifted a year earlier, and despite being on the market for five years was selling well, the Delta (1979), thanks its continued success in competition was living a second youth, and the Y10 had a slight restyling and good sales. However, the Dedra was not a strong success outside Italy. A major facelift in 1993 did little to boost the car\'s sales success and the whole Lancia range including the Dedra was withdrawn from RHD markets a year later.

Six generations of the sedan have been introduced to date, each offering V6 engines and the front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout. The first five generations of the ES were built on the Toyota Camry platform, with the sixth generation more closely related to the Avalon. Manual transmissions were offered until 1993, a lower-displacement inline-four engine became an option in Asian markets in 2010, and a gasoline-electric hybrid version was introduced in 2012. The ES was Lexus\' only front-wheel drive vehicle until 1998, when the related Lexus RX was introduced, and the sedan occupied the entry-level luxury car segment of the Lexus lineup in North America and other regions until the debut of the Lexus IS in 1999. The ES name stands for \"Executive Sedan\". However, some Lexus importers use the backronymic name, \"Elegant Sedan\".</p>\n<p>Introduced in 1989, the first-generation ES 250 was one of two vehicles in Lexus\' debut lineup, the other being the flagship LS 400. The second-generation ES 300 debuted in 1991, followed by the third-generation ES 300 in 1996, and the fourth-generation ES 300/330 in 2001. The first- through fourth-generation sedans shared body styling elements with Japan-market Toyota sedans, and a domestic market equivalent, the <b>Toyota Windom</b>, was sold until the launch of the fifth-generation ES in 2006. The word \"Windom\" is a combination of \"win\" and the suffix \"dom\" expresses a state of perpetual victory. The fifth-generation ES, featuring Lexus\' own L-finesse body styling, debuted in early 2006 as a 2007 model. The sixth-generation ES debuted in the first half of 2012 as a 2013 model, and features increased cabin dimensions due to a longer wheelbase which is shared with the full-size Toyota Avalon.</p>\n<p>Since the fourth-generation model, the Lexus ES has been aimed at the comfort luxury segment, with an emphasis on interior amenities, quietness, and ride quality, in contrast with more firm-riding sport sedans. Buyers seeking more performance-focused models are targeted by the Lexus IS and rival makes, with such models offering a sportier drive with differently tuned suspensions. In Europe, Japan, and other markets where it is not available, the Lexus GS sport sedans occupy the mid-size category in the Lexus lineup.

Originally compact in size (narrow-body), later Camry models have grown to fit the mid-size classification (wide-body)&acirc;&#128;&#148;although the two sizes co-existed in the 1990s. Since the release of the wide-bodied versions, Camry has been extolled by Toyota as the firm\'s second \"world car\" after the Corolla.

Diesel fuel versions have previously retailed at <i>Toyota Diesel Store</i>.</p>\n<p>Between 1979 and 1982, the Camry nameplate was delegated to a four-door sedan model in Japan, known as the Celica Camry. When Camry became an independent model line in 1982 with the V10 series, Toyota made it available as a five-door liftback in addition to the sedan. The subsequent Camry V20 series, debuted in 1986 with a station wagon substituting the liftback body variant and Japan-only hardtop sedans making their debut. The company replaced the V20 in 1990 with the V30 sedan and hardtop, but this model series was exclusive to Japan. Automotive tax regulations in that country dictated the retention of a narrower body as utilized in previous Camry generations. However, overseas demand for a larger Camry resulted in the development of a wide-body XV10 sedan and station wagon that arrived in 1991. Japan also received the wider XV10 as the <b>Toyota Scepter</b> (&atilde;&#131;&#136;&atilde;&#131;&uml;&atilde;&#130;&iquest;&atilde;&#131;&raquo;&atilde;&#130;&raquo;&atilde;&#131;&#151;&atilde;&#130;&iquest;&atilde;&#131;&frac14;).

Its replacement, the XV20, arrived in 1996&acirc;&#128;&#148;named Camry Gracia in Japan. It was not until the narrow V40 ended manufacture in 1998 that the Camry in Japan was to again mirror the cars sold internationally. Japanese sedans dropped the Gracia suffix in 1999, although it was retained by the wagon until its 2001 demise. From 1998, the Vista ended its Camry alignment, and instead branched into an independent model line with the V50 series for an extra generation before the nameplate was withdrawn in 2003. The next wide-body model, the XV30, came in 2001. Now sold only as a sedan, it now offered two different front- and rear-end design treatments. Japan and most global markets received one style; a separate, more conservative version covered markets in East and Southeast Asia. With the XV40 of 2006, the Camry-derived Aurion become the donor model for the more conservative Camry sold in this region. The subsequent and current XV50 sold since 2011 has resulted in even more markets adopting the alternative body panels, such as Japan and Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>When Toyota released their luxury Lexus brand in 1989, it offered a close derivative of the Camry/Vista hardtop sedan as the Lexus ES. The relationship continues to this day, but over the generations, the ES&acirc;&#128;&#148;sold as the Toyota Windom in Japan from 1991 through to 2005&acirc;&#128;&#148;gravitated further away from its Camry brethren.

It was based on an Izhevsk-modified Moskvitch 412, with the first prototype released in 1972 as a small family car. It was considered to be the first Soviet hatchback (released about a decade before the well-known Lada Samara), though the car actually possesses a station wagon body wherein the \"D\" pillar has its own support and does not gain from weight reduction (which would position the model more in the liftback family). In Russian literature the car is referred to as liftback. For the same reason, the car was given the \"Kombi\" nickname, which in a way alludes to the Combi coup&Atilde;&copy; (the word <i>kombi</i> itself meaning \"station wagon\" in German and Polish, while in Russian a station wagon is called <i>universal</i>).</p>\n<p>The Kombi had a notable success in sales within the USSR between 1974 and 1980 due to its durability, off-road capability, increased lifting capacity and was the first Izh car sold for export.

In 1995&acirc;&#128;&#148;96, when AZLK\'s revenue decreased drastically, the company was partially reacquired by AutoVAZ and renamed \"IZhAuto\".

The Oda was a practical replacement of the 1982 Izh 2125 Kombi and the last of Izhevsk-designed vehicles. A pick-up truck/panel van variant, known as <b>Izh 2717</b>, was also produced from 1991 to 2005.</p>\n<p>Early prototypes, conceived in the late 1980s, implemented the base of Moskvitch Aleko, with notable borrowings in the body style, while the powertrain featured an upgraded 2125 Kombi engine and transmission. As planned, Izh Oda entered production in late 1991 alongside the Kombi, with the reason of being destined for upmarket/luxury owners. Like the Kombi, it was also planned for export release, which never occurred.</p>\n<p>As the USSR collapsed, AZLK (which was more or less IZH\'s parent factory at the time) started losing revenue before being privatized, and IZH had to convert the production of about half its lines to other industries (such as firearms) in order to keep its automotive market running. As a result, only a faint number of about 5,000 Izh 2126 models were released between 1992 and 1995.</p>\n<p>Starting 1996, IZH dropped the Moskvitch brand and merged with AutoVAZ, creating the \"IzhAuto\" company. The merger allowed to further upgrade the Oda with VAZ-derived features, such as Lada 110\'s interior design and front-wheel drive, all while implementing Samara\'s 2106 engine. The result was a boost in consumer demand, and in 1997, all of the previous Moskvitch-based models were discontinued, while the main line switched to production of both the 2126 and the 2717 only.</p>\n<p>The best selling years of this model came between approximately 1998 and 2002, when foreign market wasn\'t made affordable to the average Russian consumer yet, and the economy car class hatchback brands (such as Lada Sputnik) did not offer much for basically the same price.

Six generations of the sedan have been introduced to date, each offering V6 engines and the front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout. The first five generations of the ES were built on the Toyota Camry platform, with the sixth generation more closely related to the Avalon. Manual transmissions were offered until 1993, a lower-displacement inline-four engine became an option in Asian markets in 2010, and a gasoline-electric hybrid version was introduced in 2012. The ES was Lexus\' only front-wheel drive vehicle until 1998, when the related Lexus RX was introduced, and the sedan occupied the entry-level luxury car segment of the Lexus lineup in North America and other regions until the debut of the Lexus IS in 1999. The ES name stands for \"Executive Sedan\". However, some Lexus importers use the backronymic name, \"Elegant Sedan\".</p>\n<p>Introduced in 1989, the first-generation ES 250 was one of two vehicles in Lexus\' debut lineup, the other being the flagship LS 400.

The first- through fourth-generation sedans shared body styling elements with Japan-market Toyota sedans, and a domestic market equivalent, the <b>Toyota Windom</b>, was sold until the launch of the fifth-generation ES in 2006. The word \"Windom\" is a combination of \"win\" and the suffix \"dom\" expresses a state of perpetual victory. The fifth-generation ES, featuring Lexus\' own L-finesse body styling, debuted in early 2006 as a 2007 model. The sixth-generation ES debuted in the first half of 2012 as a 2013 model, and features increased cabin dimensions due to a longer wheelbase which is shared with the full-size Toyota Avalon.</p>\n<p>Since the fourth-generation model, the Lexus ES has been aimed at the comfort luxury segment, with an emphasis on interior amenities, quietness, and ride quality, in contrast with more firm-riding sport sedans. Buyers seeking more performance-focused models are targeted by the Lexus IS and rival makes, with such models offering a sportier drive with differently tuned suspensions. In Europe, Japan, and other markets where it is not available, the Lexus GS sport sedans occupy the mid-size category in the Lexus lineup.

Created to appeal to a demographic of more sport-minded drivers than those who prefer the Toyota Camry sedan, the Camry Solara aspires to blend \"sporty\" looks and style with spacious practicality. The front-wheel drive Camry Solara is supposed to have a more sporty image than the Camry sedan. However, all models of the Camry Solara only feature the \"Solara\" portion of the name on exterior emblems, and the \"Camry\" portion of the name is rarely used when referring to the car in general.</p>\n<p>Prior to the production of the Camry Solara, the 2-door version of the Toyota Camry was simply known as the Camry Coupe. It was added to the third generation Camry lineup in 1993 for model year 1994 to compete with the Honda Accord and other cars in its class. However, due to it never being nearly as popular as the 4-door sedan of the Camry, the Camry Coupe was dropped in 1996 when the sedan was redesigned for model year 1997. A distant successor went into development in the mid-1990s, resulting a winning design entry in 1995 from Warren J. Crain of Calty Design and Research. After design approval, production development ran from 1995 to the first half of 1998.

Unlike its competitors, where the sedan and coup&Atilde;&copy;s are updated at the same time, the Solara\'s development lags behind of that of the Camry sedan by a couple years. Instead of mirroring the now-fourth generation Camry\'s appearance, the Solara had its own unique design with a swooped roofline, heavily creased sides, and unique front and rear fascia. The second generation, based on the 2002 Camry sedan, debuted in 2003 for model year 2004.</p>\n<p>When the Camry sedan entered its seventh generation, there were no plans to update the Camry Solara to that platform. The Solara sold below expectations, as it inherited the unexciting handling from its Camry parent.

Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced, the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.</p>\n<p>Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or \"People\'s Car\"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the <i>K&Atilde;&curren;fer</i> (German for \"beetle\") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the <i>Coccinelle</i> (French for ladybug).</p>\n<p>The original 25&#160;hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph), which would be a viable speed on the <i>Reichsautobahn</i> system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40&#160;hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the \"classic\" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia, Type 2 and external coachbuilders. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6&#160;percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6&#160;percent in 1956. The 1948 Citro&Atilde;&laquo;n 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle. In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a \"retro\"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the \"New Beetle\", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1. It remained in production through 2010, being succeeded in 2011 by the more aggressively styled Beetle (A5).</p>\n<p>In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citro&Atilde;&laquo;n DS.</p>\n<p></p>\n',8.54,8.13,9.34,9.31,6.92,16012.17,2,NULL),(20728,219,'2717','Izh','<p><b>Izh 2126</b>, nicknamed \"<b>Oda</b>\" (Russian: &ETH;&#158;&ETH;&acute;&ETH;&deg;, for ode), is a compact hatchback produced by the Soviet automotive maker IZh (later Russian \"OAO Izhmash\", and eventually \"IzhAuto\") between 1992 and 2005. The Oda was a practical replacement of the 1982 Izh 2125 Kombi and the last of Izhevsk-designed vehicles. A pick-up truck/panel van variant, known as <b>Izh 2717</b>, was also produced from 1991 to 2005.</p>\n<p>Early prototypes, conceived in the late 1980s, implemented the base of Moskvitch Aleko, with notable borrowings in the body style, while the powertrain featured an upgraded 2125 Kombi engine and transmission. As planned, Izh Oda entered production in late 1991 alongside the Kombi, with the reason of being destined for upmarket/luxury owners. Like the Kombi, it was also planned for export release, which never occurred.</p>\n<p>As the USSR collapsed, AZLK (which was more or less IZH\'s parent factory at the time) started losing revenue before being privatized, and IZH had to convert the production of about half its lines to other industries (such as firearms) in order to keep its automotive market running. As a result, only a faint number of about 5,000 Izh 2126 models were released between 1992 and 1995.</p>\n<p>Starting 1996, IZH dropped the Moskvitch brand and merged with AutoVAZ, creating the \"IzhAuto\" company. The merger allowed to further upgrade the Oda with VAZ-derived features, such as Lada 110\'s interior design and front-wheel drive, all while implementing Samara\'s 2106 engine. The result was a boost in consumer demand, and in 1997, all of the previous Moskvitch-based models were discontinued, while the main line switched to production of both the 2126 and the 2717 only.</p>\n<p>The best selling years of this model came between approximately 1998 and 2002, when foreign market wasn\'t made affordable to the average Russian consumer yet, and the economy car class hatchback brands (such as Lada Sputnik) did not offer much for basically the same price. The Oda also briefly sold in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus around 2003, which was a promising future for both IzhAuto\'s models.</p>\n<p>However, in early 2005, Russian government overtook country\'s part in the European emission standards, for which AutoVAZ redesigned its vehicles. IzhAuto, however, refused to participate in the program, which obliged the company to discontinue all of its models, judged not to meet new Russian gas emission standard\'s qualification.
